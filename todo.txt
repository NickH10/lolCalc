In Progress:
* populate champ pages with all their data
* make tweaks to skins (animations, arrows bordering image, circle logic, better title, etc...)
* rebuild directory structure for angular
* put search into directive to use on all pages instead of having it included on index page

To Do:
* when showing and hiding images, header moves over oddly
* Set up auto generation of css with grunt and sass
* failure case of getting champ data on champ controller
* create proper loading screen (loading.gif!)
* create variables page for sass
* add header to abilities
* search: meld search button into input (like google) - done, animate search bar when focused, make search bar longer, make suggestions same size as search bar(not including button), suggestions look better style-wise
* add fanciness to font icons such as color changes, drop shadows, etc... on hover, click, etc...
* redo header style and positioning - half done

Blue Sky:
* returning more than just data in util service
* make region global for data service - necessary?
* restyle everything! box-shadows, nice color schemes, rounded edges, etc...
* make clear search button run/look better
* consider swapping button header bar with hamburger menu or changing style to fit better

Done!
* find out how to put stupid wukong where he's supposed to be -_- more graceful solution than currently 
* automate versions for lolservice in dataservice - not necessary
* IMPORTANT: new way of getting champ list and ddata without having to manually add info
* (tentatively done) generate permanent champ list on dataservice without having to contact the api every time - query api ONE time, then populate the service with that info and only call api on specific items/champs/etc...
* switch from flex to more reasonable styling rules
* fix hiding suggestion menu
* switch to using champion names again
* consider tabbing champion page
* find out how to get rid of (GET http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/%7B%7BdragonVer%7D%7D/img/champion/%7B%7BchampData.key%7D%7D.png 404 (Not Found) ) error on champions page (showing up because not using ng-src)
* added temp favicon
* add dropdown of champ names as you search - https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter
* optimize filter, way too slow currently (seemingly fixed)
* added font icons!
* add end url stuff to util service? (unnecessary now)
